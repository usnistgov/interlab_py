# Chemometric Outlier Detection and Classification of 2D-NMR Spectra

The following are examples of using `interalb` on the data from the NISTmAb
Interlaboratory Study. The analysis posted here can also be found at
[our publication in Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemolab.2020.103973).
Below, you can find links to the data processing page and the three cases
discussed in the paper.
